Project Description
Nakshathra Nirnayam is a fun web app that gives troll breakup reasons based on users‚Äô nakshatras. Just select your and your partner's star signs, and the app serves up hilarious, sarcastic "cosmic" reasons for your breakup ‚Äî in Malayalam!

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Breakups are happening randomly, without proper planning or nakshatra alignment. We provide a solution to this.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a web app that takes in the user's and their partner's nakshatras, their frustrations and the relationship type, to give them the most perfect breakup date which is astrologically inclined
